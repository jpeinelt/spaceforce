# SpaceForce - a small app to practice debugging with Xcode

Since the idea of a Space Force is full of bugs we can use this to practice some debugging.

For more information watch [Advanced Debugging with XCode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/412/).

## How to use

The code has some bugs in it. Try to fix them with the debugger without restarting the app.
